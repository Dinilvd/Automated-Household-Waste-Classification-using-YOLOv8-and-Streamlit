# Automated-Household-Waste-Classification-using-YOLOv8-and-Streamlit
Used a pre-trained YOLOv8 deep learning model fine-tuned on a household waste dataset for object detection and classification. Tested the model on sample images such as banana peels and soap wrappers to evaluate detection accuracy. Built a Streamlit interface for real-time waste identification and smart recycling visualization.
